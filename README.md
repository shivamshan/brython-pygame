The previous open-source software *brython-pygame* has been superseded by the tool:

## Katagames SDK

The new tool incorporates a better pygame emulation for the Web, but also many other useful features for game development and game publishing +a special game engine.

To learn more about the **Katagames SDK** and the associated python package `katasdk`, please check this Github repo:

### How it all started?

The idea was to write a pygame module that allows interoperability
for a game initially written for only pygame+pygame,
and let users run this program in a web context.
